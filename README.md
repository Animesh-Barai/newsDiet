# News Diet
A better way to pick articles to read.

News apps like Google News, Flipboard, BBC show trending articles written
a day or two back. If say there are hundred articles written in a day, these news
apps pick just a few of them. It is a time saving feature. But they lack a key
flexibility.

Consider you havenâ€™t read any news for the last 1 monthor 1 year.If you open any of the news apps or news websites, you will still be shown trending articles written a day or two back and not last month or last year. Hence this app picks popular articles of a website in a time range we specify.
For example, techcrunch.com has 292,172 articles. But this app sorts
all those articles based on popularity. This app is a a webview of www.condense.press
and has PWA(Progressive Web App) features.
